# SCHEDULE BUN

### Pre

To run/test, you'll need [bun](https://bun.sh/)

`funcy.ts` uses a more functional approach with a path for extendability

`literal.ts` is more of a throwaway script, gets the job done

### CLI Usage

To run the more functional version, simply run `bun cli.ts funcy`

To run the more literal version, simply run `bun cli.ts literal`

### Testing

To run the test(s), simply run `bun test`
